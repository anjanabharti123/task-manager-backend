## 🚀 Project Overview

Task Management API enables:
- **Users**: Register, login, create, update, and track tasks
- **Admins**: Manage users and task categories
- **Tasks**: Organize tasks with statuses and categories

## 🧠 Key Features

- User authentication with **JWT** and Spring Security
- Task CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Category management for task organization
- Input validation for robust data handling
- Global exception handling for error management
- RESTful APIs (10+ endpoints) with HTTP best practices
- MySQL database with JPA/Hibernate
- Postman for API testing
